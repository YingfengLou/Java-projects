CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

Initial below to "sign" the above statement:

----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

The code in Class Bar, method draw() was written with significant help of
textbook section 2.10.4, the example of alien face.

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1. The outside code resources that we are  allowed to use in assignments
   for this class are limited to code written by the course staff  for the purposes
   of helping students in the course, or code from the textbook for this course.

2. Probability of two heads: 1/4
   Probability of two tails: 1/4
   Probability of one head and one tail: 1/2
   Because every coin have P(head) = P(tail) = 1/2, one-head and one-tail including
   2 situations: 1st coin is head and 2nd is tail & 1st coin is tail and 2nd is head.
   So P(one-head and one-tail) = 1/2 * 1/2 + 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/2
   P(two heads) = P(two tails) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4

3.About 10,000 trials needed to do, I mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities

4. Largest value is 2,147,483,647
   Overflow: 2,147,483,648
